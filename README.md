Overview
TaskMgr-Troll is a playful yet practical task manager with a twist. It blends a lighthearted troll vibe with solid task management capabilities. It’s designed for exploration, testing, and learning. The project invites you to experiment with task routing, scheduling quirks, and playful automation scenarios while keeping core task management solid and predictable.

Why this project exists
People learn best when they can poke at a system and see how it behaves under unexpected conditions. TaskMgr-Troll provides a safe environment to test ideas around task prioritization, conflict resolution, and user interaction, all wrapped in a friendly, fun facade. The goal is to make learning enjoyable without sacrificing clarity, reliability, or safety.

Core concepts
- Tasks: Atomic units of work with a title, description, priority, status, and timing metadata.
- Troll mode: A playful layer that simulates unusual conditions to help you test resilience and handling in edge cases.
- Scheduler: A component that decides which tasks run when, handling delays, preemption, and ordering.
- CLI-first core: A robust command-line interface that also exposes a clear programmatic API.
- Extensibility: A plugin system to add hooks, new task types, and custom behaviors.

What you can do with TaskMgr-Troll
- Create, update, and track tasks with rich metadata.
- Schedule tasks with priorities and time-based rules.
- Run tasks in a controlled environment, observing how scheduling decisions unfold.
- Simulate unusual conditions via troll mode to test robustness.
- Extend the system with plugins to add new task types, actions, and views.
- Inspect the internal state, logs, and metrics to learn how the engine behaves.

How it differs from ordinary task managers
- Built for experimentation: It’s designed to expose internal decisions and timing.
- Playful but safe: Troll mode adds whimsy without compromising safety.
- Extensible by design: Plugins and hooks let you tailor the system to your experiments.
- Emphasis on learning: Clear, transparent output helps you understand scheduling dynamics.

Architecture at a glance
- CLI layer: The primary user interaction surface. Commands are concise and predictable.
- Core engine: Manages tasks, states, and transitions. It’s the heart of the system.
- Troll layer: A lightweight module layered on top of the core, injecting edge-case scenarios.
- Scheduler: Evaluates tasks, priorities, deadlines, and dependencies to decide execution order.
- Persistence layer: Stores tasks, configurations, and run metadata.
- Observability: Logging, metrics, and traces designed for easy inspection and debugging.
- Extensibility layer: Plugins and extensions that hook into lifecycle events and provide new capabilities.

Modules and responsibilities
- Task module: Defines the Task data model, validation, and operations (create, update, delete).
- State machine: Governs task life cycles (queued, running, paused, completed, failed).
- Scheduler: Implements priorities, time slices, deadlines, and preemption behavior.
- Troll engine: Applies unpredictable yet controllable perturbations to test resilience.
- CLI: Commands for create, list, run, stop, and inspect. It also supports scripting and automation.
- Persistence: Lightweight storage to keep a history of runs, configurations, and results.
- Plugins: A clean interface to add new task types, actions, and visualization options.
- Tests: A suite that validates core behaviors under normal and troll conditions.
